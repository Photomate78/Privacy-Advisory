# Privacy-Advisory
Repository for www.navy.mil privacy advisory

## What can't be included
For Navy Communicators, keep in mind that this repository is public, so we can't include information that shouldn't be public. We already get training on this, but here are a few reminders about things we shouldn't include here:

~~Sensitive information, as described in our Open Source Policy practices guide~~
Comments that can be easily interpreted as endorsements (or other potential ethical issues)
We avoid including information that can easily go out of date and is already published somewhere else in a useful format. This includes:

* People's phone numbers, even if public information (such as their Navy work number).
* Information that is already well-covered on the Portal. Link there instead of reproducing it.
Specific org chart info (such as lists of names of supervisors and facilitators).
* We're careful about publishing information collected during research; learn more and ask #research for guidance first.
